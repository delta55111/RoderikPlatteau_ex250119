## UNF -> just leave it as it is

DB (Personnel number,Name,Date of birth,Lab code,Lab name,Research code,Research description,Research supervisor)

## 1NF -> no repeats (make sure that everything is in 1 field, 
add multiple rows if needed for res code, descr and sup) + set/mention candidate keys 

DB (Personnel number,Name,Date of birth,Lab code,Lab name,Research code,Research description,Research supervisor)


candidate keys -> (Personnel number, lab code, research code)

## 2NF -> non key values have to be dependant on the primary key

Personnel (Personnel number, name, date of birth, labcode, research code)
lab (lab code, personnel number, lab name)
research (research code, personnel number, research discription, research supervisor)

candidate keys (personnel number, labcode, researchcode - personnel number, lab code - personnel number, research code)

## 3NF -> non key values have to be non-trans. dependant on primary key
-> no non direct non key values are present, so 2NF = 3NF
