A research lab keeps track of all projects PhD students and lab technicians work on. This data consists of

    Personnel number
    Name
    Date of birth
    Lab code
    Lab name
    Research code
    Research description
    Research supervisor

Normalise this data up to 3NF, taking in to account these constraints:

    Each personnel number is unique
    Each lab has a single lab code
    Each research project has a single code and supervisor
    Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects
    Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
    Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields

Save the results of each normalisation step, together with a description of the steps you took in a document with a clear name. Add this document to your git-repository and choose a suiting commit-message.


## UNF -> just leave it as it is

DB (Personnel number,Name,Date of birth,Lab code,Lab name,Research code,Research description,Research supervisor)

## 1NF -> no repeats (make sure that everything is in 1 field, 
add multiple rows if needed for res code, descr and sup) + set/mention candidate keys 

DB (Personnel number,Name,Date of birth,Lab code,Lab name,Research code,Research description,Research supervisor)


candidate keys -> (Personnel number, lab code, research code)

## 2NF -> non key values have to be dependant on the primary key

Personnel (Personnel number, name, date of birth, labcode, research code)
lab (lab code, personnel number, lab name)
research (research code, personnel number, research discription, research supervisor)

candidate keys (personnel number, labcode, researchcode - personnel number, lab code - personnel number, research code)

## 3NF -> non key values have to be non-trans. dependant on primary key
-> no non direct non key values are present, so 2NF = 3NF
